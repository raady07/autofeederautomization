Shrimp farming is one of the most important aqua cultural activities, but farmers are facing many serious problems like shrimp diseases partly due to problems with the shrimp having to cope with poor water quality during cultivation. After the long survey with the
farmers in different regions about their practices in farming methods, the current paper provides some solutions to ensure our product Auto Switch Aqua Feeder 1(ASAF1) with new technologies replace with automation of the farming methods with their traditional practicing methods unchanged, and designed a user interface convenient and compactable for farming. User interface design, and timer controls are implemented on dsPIC30F5011 for automation of feeding methods and substantially reducing the labor cost and improve the quality of commodity.
